# RTL-Errors

It is hard to get localization right. Especially when you don't know the languages you're trying to localize for.
As proof, a lot of fantastic software have silly errors. Places where they done things _almost_ right.

The issues are even more apparent with RTL languages. In many cases, text direction will affect the UI in weird ways even when the user chooses to go for English.

Since no-one in their right mind would _choose_ to align everything RTL without speaking an RTL language, it is hard for developers to detect those issues. Therefore, I am making a collection of UI issues I encouter so that devs can learn to avoid those issues. When applicable, I also report the bugs to the developers. If you notice an issue here without a linked bug-report, let me know so that I can report the bug.

This is not an attempt at shaming. All the software listed here is good software that I use. My motivation is improving software, not hurting developers.
